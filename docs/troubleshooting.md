# Driver Troubleshooting

If you're having trouble, don't hesitate to [contact us]! We're passionate about providing good support and user experiences.

The best way to debug the Timber Docker logging plugin is to first view the Docker daemon logs. If no obvious errors are
found, verify your Timber API key is valid. If neither of these result in logs in the Timber UI, [contact us].
