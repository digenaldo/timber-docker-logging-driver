There are two options to log from docker. One is to use the [timber docker driver](https://github.com/timberio/docs) or to use the [agent](https://github.com/timberio/agent) from the disk.

We recommend using our [Docker logging driver](docker-logging-driver) as it is simple to configure and integrates with the already running Docker daemon.
